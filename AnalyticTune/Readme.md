## Analytical Tune Tool

Analytic tune tool uses the system identification mode data to obtain frequency response data and predict closed loop control responses. Used to give insight into gain and filter changes on the rate and attitude controller tune.  It assumes the aircraft is a linear system. Non-linear control elements like rate and acceleration limits will affect the accuracy of the tool prediction.
