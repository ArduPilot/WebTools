## Filter review

A FFT tool for reviewing flight logs and gyro filter settings. This tool can use either batch or raw logging. A windowed FFT is applied to the data. The transfer function of the configured filters is derived (like FilterTool) this derived transfer function is then applied to the logged data in the frequency domain.
