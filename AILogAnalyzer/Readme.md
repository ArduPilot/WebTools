## AI Log Analyzer

AI Log Analyzer is a web tool that uses an AI agent and ArduPilot’s log parser to explain your flight logs in plain language. You upload an ArduPilot binary log, ask questions like “why did altitude oscillate here?” or “show GPS health over time,” and the agent selectively parses just the data it needs, computes the right metrics, and returns clear charts and explanations.
