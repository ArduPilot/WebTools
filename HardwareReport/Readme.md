## Hardware Report

This tool uses a log or parameter set to report all the detected hardware. It presents a number of options to extract parameters ignoring user or board specific calibrations. If a log is used it will also plot a number of hardware related items, such as CPU load free memory. It also extracts waypoints, fences, rally points and files from the log. Log stats plotted to show if messages are being dropped and the composition of the log.
